# Statistical-Analysis-of-Heart-Disease-Dataset
Performed Statistical Analysis on Heart Disease Dataset to figure out the important variables categorizing the risk of heart disease

# Summary:
This notebook explains the analysis of a Heart Dataset, where we have about 303 subjects both Male and Female of varying ages. We look at 14 variables where they have different traits and a target variable that classifies if they have a risk of having heart disease. Then we are trying to analyze the data and see what significant factors are most important in flagging a person for having heart disease. In this document below i have explained my thinking process of how to start an analysis.
